### Hi there 👋

## Who am I ❔
Student, software engineer, gamer.

## What do I do ✔
Currently doing research and development on state estimation for autonomous vehicles. Autonomous enigneer at Aritotle University Racing Team Electric & Driverless - Aristurtle. Currently researching and developing models and algorithms for autonomous vehicle driving, simulation and data validation. Also working with web apps and data analysis with Python. This year I researched and developed a robust solution for Autonomous Vehicle State estimation using an Extended Kalman Filter
algorithm. Analsysis was also performed on vehicle dynamic modelling and data driven solutions for velocity estimation using neural networks.

<!-- ## What do I use 💬 -->
<!-- Diehard Linux user, i3 wm, vim, your typical all-round command line setup. You can sometimes see VSCode open on my system on rare occasions. -->

<!-- ## Current work 💹 -->
<!-- Currently working with ROS2 to create a C++ package for autonomous state estimation based on sensor data fusion with a dynamic vehicle model. --> 
<!--
## Currently learning💭
Tensorflow, using the Keras API's.

## Currently working on💹
Creating a (currently secret) web app, that will revolutionize post-COVID housing.
