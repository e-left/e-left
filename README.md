### Hi there üëã

## Who am I ‚ùî
Hello! My name is Fotis Alexandridis, I am a 19 year old undergaduate university student, and I like to write code and create stuff.

## What do I do ‚úî
I create web and mobile applications, using languages like Go, Python, Javascript, HTML and CSS and frameworks like Flutter, Flask and Express.
I also work with algorithms, data structures, and large systems using primarily C++ and sometimes Java. I also work with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
and platforms like Firebase, Google Cloud Platform and DigitalOcean. I'm also looking forward to expanding to the field of AI and Machine Learning using Tensorflow.

## What do I use üí¨
My primary text editors are Vim and Visual Studio Code, both open source. My Vim configuration file can be found on my dotfiles repository. 
My laptop runs on POP!\_OS and my desktop on Windows, with the WSL 2 system on it.
